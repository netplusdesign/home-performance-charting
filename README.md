Visualize your home energy and temperature data.

This app utilizes MySQL, PHP, jQuery, HighCharts and Javascript to view home energy usage, energy generation and temperature data. I use an eMonitor and HOBO Data Loggers to track my net zero home performance. 

Requires the following Javascript libraries, not included in this repo:
- jquery-1.7.1.min.js — I have not tested on more recent versions
- jquery.cookie.js
- purl.js — v2.2.1 — newer versions available at https://github.com/allmarkedup/purl
- date.js - from Google
- highcharts.js v3.0.7 — earlier versions may not display charts with > 1000 data points

Version 4.2.5

- Fixed sort bug. eGuage lists data in reverse chronological order. Daily and hourly results now sorted.

Version 4.2.4

- Added eGauge support
- Fixed sql bug caused on Jan 8, 2014 by replacing battery in 1st floor temperature sensor.
- added index.html

Version 4.2.1-3

- Bug fix, timezone missing
- Version 4.2.2 requires Highcharts v3.0.7
- Added plotOptions.series.turboThreshold = 0 to base-temp.js to fix problem with high charts not showing more than 1000 points.
- Significantly improved query response time for Base Temperature Analysis screen.
- Base Temperature Analysis now filters out hours with more than 500 Wh to limit effects of passive solar heating
- Base Temperature Analysis queries now return solar kWh.

Version 4.2

Added year selector to base temperature analysis.
Fixed hours chart bug with limit on query data points.

Version 4.1.1 -- Nov 30, 2013

Version 4.1 -- Nov 30, 2013

- There is a known issue with the interactive_base_temp.html page. Highcharts v2.3.5 can only display a limited number of data points. Hoping to try a new version soon and see if this is fixed.
