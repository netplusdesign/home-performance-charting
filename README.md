home-performance-charting
=========================

Visualize your home energy and temperature data.

This app utilizes MySQL, PHP, jQuery, HighCharts and Javascript to view home energy usage, energy generation and temperature data. I use an eMonitor and HOBO Data Loggers to track my net zero home performance. 

Working version posted at http://netplusdesign.com/home_performance/monthly.html

Requires the following Javascript libraries, not included in this repo:
- jquery-1.7.1.min.js — I have not tested on more recent versions
- jquery.cookie.js
- purl.js — v2.2.1 — newer versions available at https://github.com/allmarkedup/purl
